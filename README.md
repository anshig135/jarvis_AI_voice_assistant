Jarvis A.I. is a Python-based voice assistant that leverages OpenAI's language models to provide interactive and intelligent responses. It is designed to perform various tasks such as opening websites, playing music, providing the current time, and executing custom commands based on user inputs. Jarvis A.I. can also save responses from OpenAI to a text file for later reference.
